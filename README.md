# LabClinic
## Introduction

LabClinic is a project that operates in the mock terminal provided by Code Institute, in Heroku. This project was built using only one programming language, Python.

In health care, it is vital that the programmes that are used by employees are reliable, quick and as efficient as possible. These automated systems can help make a huge difference in a patient receiving the correct diagnosis or treatment. LabClinic is an automated programme that allows the user to access patient details and book laboratory blood tests with ease. 

The system gives the user multiple options when handling patient records. This includes registering a new patient, searching for an existing patient and deleting an existing patient. Laboratory blood test appointments can also be booked and cancelled for a patient. The last option is present for the user to exit the programme to shut it down.
