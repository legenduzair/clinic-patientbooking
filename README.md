# LabClinic
## Introduction

LabClinic is a project that operates in the mock terminal provided by Code Institute, in Heroku. This project was built using only one programming language, Python.

In health care, it is vital that the programmes that are used by employees are reliable, quick and as efficient as possible. These automated systems can help make a huge difference in a patient receiving the correct diagnosis and treatment. LabClinic is an automated programme that allows the user to access patient details and book laboratory blood tests with ease. 

The system gives the user multiple options when handling patient records. This includes registering a new patient, searching for an existing patient and deleting an existing patient. Laboratory blood test appointments can also be booked and cancelled for a patient. The last option is present for the user to exit the programme to shut it down.

## UX & Planning

### Project Goals
- As a developer of this command-line project, I want to build an automated programme that can assist laboratory professionals in handling patient information and booking blood tests as having the correct functional software can make a huge difference in this field as employees operate with urgent samples and tests.
- Whilst accessing the various options that are offered to the user in this programme, I want to make sure that no errors are present which would potentially cause difficulty for the user. 
- I want to develop a project that is completely accessible to the user and also operates with with my Google API's (Google Sheets and Google Drive) when they input their credentials into the terminal.

### User Stories
- As a user, I would like this programme to be functional and easy to understand. It should not be complicated and the options should be easily accessible.
- As a user, I would like to get to my options quickly whether if its registering a new patient or booking a test as there would be potentially many clients to go record in the health care field.

### Programme Structure 
Before initiating the project, I planned the structural layout of the programme by creating a flow chart on [Diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/).

The flow chart initiates with the Main Menu where the user has the option to choose from 6 inputs; Registering a patient, Booking a blood test, Cancelling a blood test, Searching for an existing patient, Deleting an existing patient and finally closing down the programme. After each task is completed, the user has the option to go continue or go back to the main menu.
